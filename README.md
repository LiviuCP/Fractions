# Fractions
A class of rational numbers

The Fractions folder contains the actual source code for the class while the other one (FractionTests) contains the unit tests.

The unit tests have been written using the Google Test platform. 

I recommend that you put the useful code and the unit testing code into 2 separate projects according to their folder representation.

Enjoy!

PS. Note: for the last test case (which tests the file stream operators) please change the path and name of the file according to your requirements.
